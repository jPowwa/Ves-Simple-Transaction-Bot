# Ves' Simple Transaction Bot

To set it up simply go into the config.json and fill in all the variables.
Regarding everything except the clientId and token they can be found by simply copying the ID's of the correct roles or channels.
Token can be found on the discord developer portal and the clientID can be found under OAuth2 -> General
After doing all that simply run the start.bat file which runs "node index.js" to start the bot.
